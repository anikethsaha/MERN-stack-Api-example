## How TO Use
   Download or clone the whole project 
   I have created the app using two ways **(With and Without flux(Redux.js)** architecture and you can use either of them
   ##### WithOut flux
      1. Simply paste the project without the **redux(option)** folder
      2. open two terminal - one for node.js server and one for webpack compilation
      3. After pasting the project run **npm install** to install all the dependencies 
      4 In one terminal run **nodemon server.js** to start the server .
      5 before running the server just compile the webpack with **npm run webpack** though I will update the bundle.js file as much as              possible
      6  Go to **http://localhost:8080/** to see the page
   ##### With flux( I am using redux.js )
      1. Simply paste the project including the **redux(option)** folder
      2. Replace the components folder, the bundle.js file replace the app.js file with main.js file from the redux(optional) folder, add the store.js file in the root dir(project dir) , replace the webpack.config.jss file too
      3. After pasting the project and changing the above changes  run **npm install** to install all the dependencies 
      4 In one terminal run **nodemon server.js** to start the server .
      5 before running the server just compile the webpack with **npm run webpack** though I will update the bundle.js file as much as              possible
      6  Go to **http://localhost:8080/** to see the page
